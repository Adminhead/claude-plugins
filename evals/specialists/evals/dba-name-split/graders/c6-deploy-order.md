The user asks for a migration plan that splits `users.name` into `first_name` and `last_name` on a table of about 80 million rows, with the old app version still live during a rolling deploy. The repo is a Flask + SQLAlchemy + Alembic service on PostgreSQL 15. Judge only the final report against the single criterion below. Do not reward length.

PASS only if this holds, otherwise FAIL.

Deploy order: it states the order of migration, backfill, code deploys and the contract step relative to the old and new app versions, and says the old version must keep working at each point.
